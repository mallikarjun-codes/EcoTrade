# 🌿 EcoTrade - The Trust Layer for Carbon Markets

**StackHack 3.0 Submission** *Track: Online Marketplace for Carbon Credits*

### 🚀 The Problem
Buying carbon offsets feels like "buying air." The market suffers from a **Trust Gap**—users pay for credits but never see the impact, leading to skepticism and low adoption.

### 💡 The Solution: "FedEx for Carbon"
EcoTrade gamifies the offset process by making it transparent, visual, and verified.
* **Impact Comparator:** Don't just compare prices. Compare SDG Goals and Auditor Ratings side-by-side.
* **Lifecycle Tracker:** A real-time visual journey of your credit from "Payment" to "Retirement" on the registry.
* **Auditor Transparency:** We replace generic user reviews with "Verified Auditor Logs" to build institutional trust.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (for animations).
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express.
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (JSON Document Store).
* **Tools:** Lucide Icons, Axios.

### ✨ Key Features
1.  **The Impact Catalog:** Verified projects with visual "Trust Badges" (VERRA/Gold Standard).
2.  **Smart Comparator:** Highlights the "Better Impact" and "Best Price" automatically.
3.  **The "Wow" Tracker:** A state-machine simulation of the credit retirement process.
